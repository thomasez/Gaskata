# Gaskata
Gaskata, a AAA system. Later with subscriptions, payment, invoiceing and so on. This is *not* meant as the front-end but the back end. The reason for this is that there can be many front-ends needing this. And they are very diverse. Alas, they shall communicate with this back-end with REST.

Right now, all it does is authenticate a user.

Phase 1:
 * Authenticate users
 * Registering users
 * Managing users
